# Front-End Stack
- React: Defines the structure and content of your web pages
- CSS: Styles, defining layout, colors, typography, and other visual aspects to enhance presentation

# Back-End Stack
- Server-side Languages (Python Flask): Handles server-side logic, data processing, and communication with databases. Flask, a Python web framework, provides a lightweight and flexible platform for building web applications, allowing you to create dynamic content, handle user requests, and manage session data effectively
- Databases(MongoDB): Stores user registration information in a NoSQL document database
- MongoDB (handled by Flask-PyMongo): Store user information such as name, email, hashed password, registration, time, etc
- Flask sessions: Store user authentication state and information between requests
- Bcrypt (handled by Passlib): Securely hash user passwords before storing them in the database

#AI Help
- Explore Python and Flask framework for backend development and familiarize with MongoDB.
- Receive guidance on Python syntax, registration, login, and contracts.
- Establish backend-to-frontend connectivity.
